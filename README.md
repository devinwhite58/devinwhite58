- 👋 Hi, I’m @devinwhite58
- 👀 I’m interested in innovation and project management
- 🌱 I’m currently learning civil engineering, specifically ways to develop and maintain smart infrastructure systems
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to infrastructure and autonomous systems! I am still a beginner with 
Git & GitHub but I am interested in how it opens up the possibility to collaborate on projects with people all across the world.
